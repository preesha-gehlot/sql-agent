      Use this tool to get the schema/structure information for a specific table in the northwind database.
      This tool is essential for understanding the database structure before writing SQL queries.
      Always use this tool when you need to know what columns exist in a table.
      Do NOT guess table names - use the list-tables-northwind-db tool first if you're unsure.
      Example usage: If you want to know the structure of a "Customer" table, use table_name = "Customer". 
      Example:
      {{
          "table_name": "Customer"
      }}
      Example:
      {{
          "table_name": "Product"
      }}
    parameters:
      - name: table_name
        type: string
