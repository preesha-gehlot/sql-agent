                Query: Give the name of the employee that is CEO of the company.
                Ground Truth: Sara Davis.
                Agent Response: The employee who is the CEO of the company is Sara Davis.

                Evaluation: The Ground Truth Answer provides a specific name, 'Sara Davis', while the Agent Answer does not provide any specific information related to the name, but instead mentions a limitation in its ability to answer questions.
