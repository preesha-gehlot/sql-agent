                ✓ test_001 (8.78s)
                Query: Give the name of the employee that is CEO of the company.
                Ground Truth: Sara Davis.
                Agent Response: The CEO of the company is Sara Davis.
                Evaluation: Both answers refer to the same person, Sara Davis. The agent answer provides additional information that Sara Davis is the CEO of the company, but it doesn't contradict the ground truth answer.
            
                ✗ test_002 (5.95s)
                Query: Who is the CEO of the company
                Ground Truth: Sara Davis.
                Agent Response: I can only answer questions related to Northwind data.
                Evaluation: The ground truth answer provides a specific name, 'Sara Davis', while the agent's answer does not provide any specific information related to the ground truth. Instead, it mentions a limitation in its ability to answer questions, which is not related to the ground truth answer.

2. Product RJVNM
3. Product GEEOO
                Evaluation: Both answers list the same three products: Product QMVUN, Product RJVNM, and Product GEEOO. The agent answer provides additional context by specifying these products were part of order 10248, but this does not change the semantic consistency between the two answers.
